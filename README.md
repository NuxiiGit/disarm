# Disarm

Disarm is a [Spriter](https://brashmonkey.com/spriter-pro/) skeletal animation runtime for GameMaker Studio 2.3. Disarm is written in pure GML in order to support the greatest possible range of platforms.

## Features

Disarm supports most of the stable features of Spriter Pro, such as:
 - Multiple entities per armature
 - Pivot points
 - Character maps
 - Sprite and point attachments
 - Bone keyframes for translation, scale, rotation, parent, and transparency
 - Attachment keyframes for translation, scale, rotation, parent, transparency, pivot point, frame index, and z-index
 - Animating between keyframes instantly, or by using linear interpolation, quadratic interpolation, or cubic animation
 - Animating the z-order and hierarchy of bones and sprites

Other features supported by Disarm include:
 - Combine and layer multiple character maps
 - Modify entity data at runtime 
 - Render animations whose sprites span multiple texture pages
 - Blend between multiple animations
 - Bake groups of animations into a sequence of vertex buffers that can be reused later

## Known Bugs

Does not support the HTML5 export! If you want to fix the bugs and make it work, be my guest.
